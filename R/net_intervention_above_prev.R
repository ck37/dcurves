#' @title Net Interventions Avoided Above Prevalence
#'
#' @description
#' In the software for decision curve analysis, we allow users to specify an
#' option that shows net benefit in terms of the difference between treat all and treat none.
#' This, however, does not make sense if threshold probability is greater than the prevalence.
#' Why ask "what is the net reduction in interventions compared to a treat all
#' strategy at a threshold where you shouldnâ€™t use the treat all strategy?"
